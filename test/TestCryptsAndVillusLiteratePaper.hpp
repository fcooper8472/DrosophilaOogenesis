 * = Cell-based simulation: multiple crypts and a villus =
 *
 * On this wiki page we describe in detail the code that is used to run this example from the paper.
 *
 * The simulation is a node-based off-lattice simulation. In other words, cells are represented by points
 * in space (nodes) and are allowed to move without being confined to certain lattice sites.
 *
 * This example is somewhat unusual, in that we enforce a boundary condition that limits the cells'
 * movement to a 2D surface in 3D space.
 *
 * We show use of `CellKiller`s - both random and acting on a plane at the top of the villus.
 *
 * We also show the use of lineage tracking, and cell-signalling leading to Delta-Notch patterning.
 *
 * This example uses some source files that can be found in the `Plos2013/src` folder.
 *
 * Remember to run with `build=GccOptNative` for speed.
 * e.g.
 * `scons build=GccOptNative test_suite=projects/Plos2013/test/TestCryptsAndVillusLiteratePaper.hpp`
 *
 * The easiest way to visualize this simulation is with Paraview, as follows. After opening Paraview,
 * load the file results.pvd, then click "Apply" in the object inspector panel. As this simulation
 * uses a `NodeBasedCellPopulation`, you must use glyphs to visualize cells: click the button marked
 * "Glyph" in the toolbar of common filters; specify cells to be displayed as spheres; then click "Apply".
 *
 *
 * == Code overview ==
 *
 * The first thing to do is to include the necessary header files.
